# Microsoft-Future-Ready-Talent-Diabetes-Predictor
Using machine learning algorithms, this project was created to produce precise predictions about whether or not a person had diabetes. 
This project enables prompt diabetes identification so that no time is lost and the user does not have to wait through drawn-out hospital procedures or for a long period to receive the results.

# Technologies Used: #
  I used the following tools and technologies in order to successfully make the project: <br />
    1. Python <br />
    2. HTML <br />
    3. CSS <br />
    4. File Handling technique <br />
    5. Flask (Framework) <br />
    6. sklearn library for implementing various Machine learning algorithms <br />
    
   
  # Project Structure #
   This project has four major parts : <br />
   1. model.py : This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict the chances of a patient having Diabetes. <br />
   2. app.py: This contains Flask APIs that receives patient's details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and predicts whether the  patient has Diabetes or not. <br />
   3. templates: This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter various fields inorder to know his chances of having        disease.  <br />
   4. static: It contains the CSS part of the project.  <br />
